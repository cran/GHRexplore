\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame containing equally spaced (daily, weekly, monthly)
covariate or disease case observations for one or multiple locations.}

\item{var}{Name of the column identifying the variable to be plotted.}

\item{time}{Name of the variable that identifies the temporal dimension
of the data frame. Its values must be in date format ("yyyy-mm-dd")
representing the day of observation for daily data, the first day of the
week for weekly, or the first day of the month for monthly observations.}

\item{type}{Character that specifies the type of variable in \code{var}.
Possible values include 'cov' (covariate, default), 'counts' (case counts),
and 'inc' (case incidence). If \code{type='inc'}, \code{pop} is required.}

\item{pop}{Character identifying the variable name for population. Only needed
if \code{type='inc'}.}

\item{pt}{Numerical only used for \code{type='inc'}. It represents the scale of the
person-time (default 100,000) for incidence rates.}

\item{area}{Name of variable that identifies the different locations
(e.g., areal units) for which a time series is available.}

\item{aggregate_space}{Name of variable used to define spatial aggregation groups.}

\item{aggregate_time}{Temporal scale used to perform
temporal aggregation. Options are: "week" (ISO 8601), "month", "year".}

\item{aggregate_space_fun}{Character indicating the function to be used
in the aggregation over space for \code{type="cov"}. Options are "mean" (default),
"median", "sum". For case counts and incidence, "sum" is always applied.}

\item{aggregate_time_fun}{Character indicating the function to be used
in the aggregation over time for \code{type="cov"}. Options are "mean" (default),
"median", "sum". For case counts and incidence, "sum" is always applied.}

\item{facet}{If TRUE a separate time series for each space unit is plotted in
different facets.}

\item{highlight}{ID of the \code{area} to be highlighted. Using this option will
only color the selected spatial unit and set all the rest to grey.}

\item{transform}{Character, defaults to "identity" (i.e., no transformation).
Transforms the y-axis for better visualization. Useful options include
"log10p1" \code{log10(x+1)} useful for case counts and incidence with 0s, or
any of the in-built ggplot2 options such as  "log10" \code{log10(x)}, "log1p" \code{log(x+1)},
and "sqrt" \code{sqrt(x)} (check all possible options using \code{?scale_y_continuous}).}

\item{title}{Optional title of the plot.}

\item{var_label}{Character with a custom name for the case or covariate variable.}

\item{legend}{Character with a custom name for the legend.}

\item{ylab}{Label for the y-axis.}

\item{xlab}{Label for the x-axis.}

\item{free_y_scale}{Logical, default FALSE. Allows different scales in the
y_axis when facets are used.}

\item{palette}{GHR, RColorBrewer or colorspace palette (e.g. "Purp").
Single R colors in \code{colors()} or hex codes can be used for single time series
or facets. Use "-" before the palette name (e.g., "-Reds") to reverse it.
Defaults to a dark green when \code{area} is NULL, when \code{facet} is TRUE or when
\code{highlight} is used (i.e. single time series), otherwise defaults to the
"IDE2" palette.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 time series plot.
