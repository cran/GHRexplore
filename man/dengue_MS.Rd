\item{meso_name}{Name of each meso region.}
\item{state_code}{Unique ID number for each state (1 unit).}
\item{state_name}{Name of each state.}
\item{region_code}{Unique ID number given to each Brazilian Region.
All observations come from the "Southeast Region".}
\item{region_name}{Name of each Brazilian Region.
All observations come from the "Southeast Region".}

\item{biome_name}{Biome name.}
\item{ecozone_code}{Ecozone code.}
\item{ecozone_name}{Ecozone name.}
\item{main_climate}{Most prevalent climate regime in the microregion.
Based on Koppen Geiger climate regimes.}
\item{month}{Calendar month index, 1 = January, 12 = December.}
\item{year}{Year 2000 - 2019.}
\item{time}{Time index starting at 1 for January 2000.}
\item{dengue_cases}{Number of notified dengue cases registered in the
notifiable diseases system in Brazil (SINAN) in the microregion of
reference, at the month of first symptoms.}

\description{
Monthly number of notified dengue cases by
municipality in the \emph{Mato Grosso do Sul} state of Brazil and a set
of spatial and spatio-temporal covariates.

\details{
In addition to the dengue counts, the dataset contains a set of environmental,
socio-economic and meteo-climatic factors. This dataset is a subset of the
original containing observations over the entire Brazil.
